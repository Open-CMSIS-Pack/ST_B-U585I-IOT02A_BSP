# B-U585I-IOT02A Discovery kit for IoT node

## Overview

The B-U585I-IOT02A Discovery kit provides a complete demonstration and development platform for the STM32U585AI
microcontroller, featuring an Arm Cortex-M33 core, 2 Mbytes of Flash memory and 786 Kbytes of SRAM, as well as smart
peripheral resources. This Discovery kit enables a wide diversity of applications by exploiting low-power communication,
multi way sensing, and direct connection to cloud servers.

It includes Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® modules, as well as microphones, temperature and humidity, magnetometer, accelerometer and
gyroscope, pressure, time-of-flight, and gesture-detection sensors.

The support for ARDUINO® Uno V3, STMod+, and Pmod™ connectivity provides unlimited expansion capabilities with a large
choice of specialized add-on boards. The on-board STLINK-V3E debugger provides out-of-the-box debugging capabilities, as
well as a USB Virtual COM port bridge.

## Getting started

- [User manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um2839-discovery-kit-for-iot-node-with-stm32u5-series-stmicroelectronics.pdf)

### ST-LINK driver installation and firmware upgrade (on Microsoft Windows)

1. Download the latest [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).
2. Extract the archive and run `dpinst_amd64.exe`. Follow the displayed instructions.
3. Download the latest [ST-LINK firmware upgrade](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html).
4. Extract the archive and run the `ST-LinkUpgrade.exe` program.
5. Connect the board to your PC using a USB cable and wait until the USB enumeration is completed.
6. In the **ST-Link Upgrade** program, press the **Device Connect** button.
7. When the ST-LINK driver is correctly installed, the current ST-LINK version is displayed.
8. Press the **Yes >>>>** button to start the firmware upgrade process.

### WiFi firmware update for MXCHIP EMW3080B (on Microsoft Windows)

1. Connect the board to your PC using a USB cable and wait until the USB enumeration is completed.
2. Start the **Serial Terminal** application and connect to the **STMicroelectronics STLink Virtual COM Port (COMx)** (115200-8-N-1).
3. Download the latest [MXCHIP EMW3080B firmware](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/x-wifi-emw3080b.html).
4. Extract the archive.
5. Drag and drop the `EMW3080update_B-U585I-IOT02A-RevC_V2.3.4_SPI.bin` file, located in the `./V2.3.4/SPI` subfolder, to
   the **MBED microcontroller USB Device** that shows up in the File Explorer as `DIS_U585AI` for TrustZone disabled device or
   as `NOD_U585AI` for TrustZone enabled device.
6. After file is copied to the **MBED microcontroller USB Device** the chip will restart and there will be some text message
   in the **Serial Terminal** similar to below:
   ```
   ################### Welcome to EMW3080 firmware update utility 1.1.0 for board RevB or RevC ###################
   
   STM32> Configured for MXCHIP embedded FW ST-EMW3080B_V2.3.4_SPI.OTA.BIN 0x8000234 / 686672 bytes
   STM32> Push the user button (Blue) to program the EMW3080 device or enter command
   STM32> MCU system clock 160 MHz, Uart Baud rate 921600, Software emulated UART bit duration 173 cycles
   
   
   "      help"            print this message
   "      boot"            boot EMW3080 (needed before using mx command) 
   "        mx"            mx [cmd]: send command to mxchip device (cmd which requires ymodem protocol can't be used)
   "     flash"            flash mxchip firmware (same as pushing the blue button)
   "     check"            check mxchip firmware
   .[12hSTM32>
   ```
7. Type `flash` and press Enter, now wait for process to finish, the text in the **Serial Terminal** should look similar to below:
   ```
   STM32> 
   STM32> Boot done successfully
   STM32> Waiting for the EMW3080 to be ready for programming (a few seconds pass before receiving a message)
   Transfering packets ...

   STM32> Programming successful, reset the device to get back to prompt
   ```
8. **Power-off** and **power-on** the board which now has updated MXCHIP EMW3080B firmware.
